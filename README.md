Quantity Measurement App
Overview
The Quantity Measurement App is a Java-based application developed to model and manipulate different measurement systems. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented design, Test Driven Development (TDD), and clean coding practices.

The application evolves incrementally through multiple use cases (UC1–UC9), starting from simple equality checks and progressing to a scalable system supporting multiple measurement domains such as length and weight.

Development Approach
Test Driven Development (TDD)
Write test cases first
Implement minimal code to pass tests
Refactor while maintaining correctness
Design-Develop-Test (DDT)
Design architecture
Implement features
Validate through testing
The project uses a hybrid approach combining both methodologies.

Use Case Implementation
UC1: Feet Equality
Compare two values in feet
Implemented using equals() method
Handles null, type safety, and precision
UC2: Feet and Inches Equality
Introduced Inches measurement
Independent comparison within same unit types
UC3: Generic Length Model
Replaced separate classes with a unified Length class
Introduced LengthUnit enum
Enabled cross-unit comparison
UC4: Extended Units
Added Yards and Centimeters
Achieved scalability through enum extension
UC5: Unit Conversion
Implemented conversion between units
Example: Feet to Inches, Centimeters to Feet
UC6: Addition of Lengths
Added support for combining two measurements
Result returned in the base unit of the first operand
UC7: Addition with Target Unit
Extended addition functionality to support a specified output unit
Example: result in yards or centimeters
UC8: Refactoring for Clean Design
Moved LengthUnit to a separate file
Improved modularity and maintainability
Followed Single Responsibility Principle
UC9: Weight Measurement System
Introduced a new domain: Weight

Implemented Weight and WeightUnit

Supported operations:

Conversion (kg, gram, pound)
Addition
Key Concepts
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Encapsulation and immutability
Method overriding (equals, hashCode)
Floating-point comparison using Double.compare()
Enum-based design for unit handling
Modular architecture
Scalability across domains
Running the Application
Compile and Run
mvn compile
mvn exec:java
Run Tests
mvn test
Git Workflow
Each use case is implemented in a separate branch:

main – stable version
UC1-feet-equality
UC2-feet-inch-equality
UC3-generic-model
UC4-extended-units
UC5-unit-conversion
UC6-addition
UC7-target-unit
UC8-refactor
UC9-weight
Branches are merged into main after successful implementation and testing.

Note
This project is developed as part of an academic exercise to demonstrate progressive system design, clean coding practices, and scalable architecture using Java.
